        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it user-friendly.  Think of HTML like the frame of a house. </li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. </li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage and is extremely important for SEO.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and defines how webpage content is presented to users. </li>
          <li>Inline CSS, Internal CSS Style Sheet and External CSS Style sheets are three ways to style a webpage.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. </li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>JavaScript is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
        <li> Remember that arrays are zero indexed and sequential - that means 0 is the first number.</li>
        <li>In a for loop, the first statement determines the starting point of loop, the second statement is the condition, and the final statements allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
        <li>Functions are reusable blocks of code that contain instructions to perform a specific task.
